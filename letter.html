    <h1>My Love,</h1>

    <p class="letter">
        From the day you walked into my life, something shifted inside me.
        You didn’t just become someone I love —
        you became my peace, my happiness, my safe place.
        <br><br>
        You inspire me to be better.
        You make ordinary moments unforgettable.
        And no matter what happens,
        I promise to stand beside you with loyalty and love.
        <br><br>
        I don’t just love you.
        I choose you.
        Every single day.
    </p>
