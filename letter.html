<h1>My Love Letter ❤️</h1>

<p>My dearest,</p>
<p>From the moment we met, my heart knew you were the one. Every day with you is a blessing, and I can't wait for countless more memories together.</p>
<p>I love you not because of who you are, but because of who I become when I am with you.</p>
 <p>You are my favorite notification, my favorite distraction, my favorite everything.</p>
 <p>If I had a flower for every time I thought of you, I could walk through my garden forever</p>
<p>Forever yours ❤️</p>
