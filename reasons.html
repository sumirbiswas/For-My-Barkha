<h1>Reasons I Love You ❤️</h1>

<ul class="memory-layout">
    <li>You make me smile every day 😊</li>
    <li>Your kindness is unmatched 🌸</li>
    <li>Every moment with you is magical ✨</li>
   <li>I have waited for you in a thousand lifetimes, and I will find you in a thousand more. You are the answer to every prayer I never knew I was making.</li>
   <li>Loving you is not a choice, it is gravity. I am helpless against the pull of you</li>
   <li>You are the first thought that greets me when consciousness returns each morning, and the last prayer on my lips each night.</li>
</ul>
